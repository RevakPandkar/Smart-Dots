The application of the Genetic Algorithm is shown by training a bunch of dots.

The dots first start by having random directions and are slowly trained as they keep reaching closer to the goal.

The fitness of each dot is calculated based on its distance from the goal.

In the No Splicing folder, the dots have weaker training as only one parent is selected and used to start the next generation.

The Splicing folder contains the program where the two dots are selected as the best and a crossover function is also used to start the next generation.
